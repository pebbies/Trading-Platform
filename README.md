# Trading Platform UI

This is a UI for a trading platform built using Javascript, React.js, and Tailwind CSS. Below is a picture preview of the platform, which includes interactable elements, such as order type, order size, and leverage sliders. The chart is built using TradingView's lightweight-charts and is currently populated with fake data.

## Running Locally

To run this website locally, you just need to:

```npm install```

and

```npm start```

In the future, I may hook the chart up to a price stream using an API, but that would require a dot env file and most likely wouldn't be able to be run on other devices, so for now it just remains a basic front-end mockup.
